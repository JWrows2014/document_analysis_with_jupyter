# Class Data

Option 1 for obtaining the class data and example Jupyter Notebook is to download the following to personal computer. Again, installation of Jupyter Lab and other computation tools is required.

* [Example Jupyter notebook](../data/example.ipynb)
* [hbr_uhr_deg_chr22_with_significance.csv](../data/hbr_uhr_deg_chr22_with_significance.csv)
* [hbr_uhr_normalized_counts_pca.csv](../data/hbr_uhr_normalized_counts_pca.csv)
* [hbr_uhr_top_deg_normalized_counts.csv](../data/hbr_uhr_top_deg_normalized_counts.csv)
* [image1](../images/jupyter_1.png)
* [image2](../images/jupyter_2.png)
* [image3](../images/jupyter_3.png)
* [image4](../images/jupyter_4.png)
* [image5](../images/jupyter_5.png)

!!! Tip
    To download the example Jupyter notebook on Google Chrome right click on the link and choose "Save Link As". On Safari, right click on the link and select "Download Linked File".

Option 2 is to visit [https://github.com/JWrows2014/document_analysis_with_jupyter](https://github.com/JWrows2014/document_analysis_with_jupyter){target=_blank}, click on the green button labeled "<> Code" and select "Download as ZIP". The example Jupyter Notebook, data, and images will download as a zip file and unzipping, change into the project folder and start Jupyter Lab to try out the example notebook.
